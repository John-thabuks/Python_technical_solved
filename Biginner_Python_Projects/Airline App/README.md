# Airline application
# Creation of a booking airline application for passagers
    - This application is UNIX based.
    - We will have a user input where we will specify the number of slots available in a specified plane.
    - From there we will input the names of passangers would wish to book for the flight
    - The output will print the names of those booked and those not booked when the slots are over.
